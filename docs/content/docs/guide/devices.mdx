```ts
client.on("deviceAdded", ({ device }) => {
  console.log(device.name, device.displayName);
  console.log("Features:", device.features);
});

await client.startScanning();
```

Devices are represented by [`Device`](/docs/reference/device) instances, created internally by the client when the server reports new hardware. You never construct a `Device` directly -- they arrive through events and the `client.devices` getter.

## Discovery

Call `startScanning()` to begin device discovery on the server. The server scans all configured protocols (Bluetooth, serial, HID, etc.) and reports each device via the `deviceAdded` event. Scanning continues until you call `stopScanning()` or the server emits `scanningFinished`.

```ts
await client.startScanning();

client.on("scanningFinished", () => {
  console.log("Scan complete");
});

// Stop manually if needed
await client.stopScanning();
```

Devices persist across scans. A device only triggers `deviceAdded` once. If the device disconnects, a `deviceRemoved` event fires. If the server updates a device's metadata, `deviceUpdated` fires with both the new and previous `Device` instances.

You can also request the current device list at any time with `client.requestDeviceList()`. This reconciles local state with the server and emits the appropriate add/remove/update events.

## Device Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `index` | `number` | Server-assigned identifier, stable for the session |
| `name` | `string` | Internal firmware name |
| `displayName` | `string \| null` | User-facing name from the server, or `null` |
| `messageTimingGap` | `number` | Minimum interval (ms) between commands recommended by the server |
| `features` | `DeviceFeatures` | Parsed input and output feature descriptors |

The `features` object contains `inputs` and `outputs` arrays describing every sensor and actuator the device exposes, including their types, ranges, and capabilities.

## Capabilities

Before sending commands, check whether the device supports them:

```ts
if (device.canOutput("Vibrate")) {
  await device.vibrate(50);
}

if (device.canRead("Battery")) {
  const level = await device.readSensor("Battery");
  console.log(`Battery: ${level}%`);
}
```

| Capability | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `canOutput(type)` | `boolean` | Has at least one output feature of the given type |
| `canRead(type)` | `boolean` | Has a sensor that supports one-shot reads |
| `canSubscribe(type)` | `boolean` | Has a sensor that supports subscriptions |
| `canRotate` | `boolean` | Supports `Rotate` or `RotateWithDirection` (getter, not a method) |
| `canPosition` | `boolean` | Supports `Position` or `HwPositionWithDuration` (getter, not a method) |

The 10 output types are: `Vibrate`, `Rotate`, `RotateWithDirection`, `Oscillate`, `Constrict`, `Spray`, `Temperature`, `Led`, `Position`, `HwPositionWithDuration`. The 5 sensor types are: `Battery`, `RSSI`, `Pressure`, `Button`, `Position`.
