description: Modern TypeScript client for the Buttplug protocol v4
---

import { Card, Cards } from "fumadocs-ui/components/card";

**buttplug.js** is a type-safe TypeScript client for the [Buttplug Intimacy Protocol](https://buttplug.io) v4. It connects to a Buttplug server over WebSocket, discovers devices, and controls them through a high-level API.

```ts
import { ButtplugClient } from "@zendrex/buttplug.js";

const client = new ButtplugClient("ws://localhost:12345");

client.on("deviceAdded", ({ device }) => {
  device.vibrate(50);
});

await client.connect();
await client.startScanning();
```

## Features

- **Protocol v4** -- 10 output types and 5 sensor input types: vibration, rotation, position, oscillation, constriction, and more
- **Type-safe API** -- Full TypeScript types with Zod schema validation for autocomplete and compile-time safety
- **Pattern Engine** -- Keyframe-based pattern playback with built-in presets, custom tracks, easing curves, and loop control
- **Auto-reconnect** -- Configurable reconnection with exponential backoff, attempt limits, and lifecycle events
- **Ping Keep-alive** -- Automatic ping management with configurable intervals to maintain server connections
- **Runtime Agnostic** -- Works in any JavaScript runtime with WebSocket support

## Prerequisites

**[Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/)** acts as the Buttplug server. Install and start it before connecting from your application. The default WebSocket address is `ws://localhost:12345`.

Any JavaScript runtime with WebSocket support works: Node.js 18+, Bun, Deno, or modern browsers. The library has zero native dependencies.
