title: Constants
description: Exported constant values.
---

All constants are exported from the package root:

```ts
import {
  OUTPUT_TYPES,
  INPUT_TYPES,
  EASING_VALUES,
  PRESET_NAMES,
  ErrorCode,
} from "@zendrex/buttplug.js";
```

## OUTPUT_TYPES

All output actuator types defined by the Buttplug v4 protocol. Typed as `readonly OutputType[]`.

```ts
const OUTPUT_TYPES = [
  "Vibrate",
  "Rotate",
  "RotateWithDirection",
  "Oscillate",
  "Constrict",
  "Spray",
  "Temperature",
  "Led",
  "Position",
  "HwPositionWithDuration",
] as const;
```

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"Vibrate"` | Vibration motor control |
| `"Rotate"` | Rotation motor (speed only) |
| `"RotateWithDirection"` | Rotation motor with clockwise/counter-clockwise direction |
| `"Oscillate"` | Oscillation motor control |
| `"Constrict"` | Constriction pressure actuator |
| `"Spray"` | Spray mechanism |
| `"Temperature"` | Temperature control (signed values: positive = heat, negative = cool) |
| `"Led"` | LED brightness control |
| `"Position"` | Linear position actuator |
| `"HwPositionWithDuration"` | Position actuator with timed movement duration |

## INPUT_TYPES

All input sensor types defined by the Buttplug v4 protocol. Typed as `readonly InputType[]`.

```ts
const INPUT_TYPES = [
  "Battery",
  "RSSI",
  "Pressure",
  "Button",
  "Position",
] as const;
```

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"Battery"` | Battery level percentage |
| `"RSSI"` | Bluetooth signal strength |
| `"Pressure"` | Pressure sensor reading |
| `"Button"` | Physical button state |
| `"Position"` | Position sensor reading |

## EASING_VALUES

All easing curve identifiers used for keyframe interpolation. Typed as `readonly Easing[]`.

```ts
const EASING_VALUES = [
  "linear",
  "easeIn",
  "easeOut",
  "easeInOut",
  "step",
] as const;
```

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"linear"` | Constant velocity interpolation |
| `"easeIn"` | Starts slow, accelerates |
| `"easeOut"` | Starts fast, decelerates |
| `"easeInOut"` | Slow start and end, fast middle |
| `"step"` | Instant jump to target value (no interpolation) |

## PRESET_NAMES

All available built-in pattern preset names. Typed as `readonly PresetName[]`.

```ts
const PRESET_NAMES = [
  "pulse",
  "wave",
  "ramp_up",
  "ramp_down",
  "heartbeat",
  "surge",
  "stroke",
] as const;
```

| Name | Description | Default Loop | Compatible With |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `"pulse"` | Square wave on/off | Yes | Vibrate, Rotate, RotateWithDirection, Oscillate, Constrict |
| `"wave"` | Smooth sine wave oscillation | Yes | Vibrate, Rotate, RotateWithDirection, Oscillate, Constrict |
| `"ramp_up"` | Gradual increase to maximum | No | Vibrate, Rotate, RotateWithDirection, Oscillate, Constrict |
| `"ramp_down"` | Gradual decrease to zero | No | Vibrate, Rotate, RotateWithDirection, Oscillate, Constrict |
| `"heartbeat"` | Ba-bump heartbeat rhythm | Yes | Vibrate, Rotate, RotateWithDirection, Oscillate, Constrict |
| `"surge"` | Build to peak then release | No | Vibrate, Rotate, RotateWithDirection, Oscillate, Constrict |
| `"stroke"` | Full-range position strokes | Yes | Position, HwPositionWithDuration |

## ErrorCode

Numeric error codes returned by the Buttplug protocol.

```ts
const ErrorCode = {
  UNKNOWN: 0,
  INIT: 1,
  PING: 2,
  MESSAGE: 3,
  DEVICE: 4,
} as const;
```

| Key | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UNKNOWN` | `0` | Unknown or unclassified error |
| `INIT` | `1` | Initialization or handshake error |
| `PING` | `2` | Ping timeout -- server will halt devices |
| `MESSAGE` | `3` | Malformed or invalid message |
| `DEVICE` | `4` | Device-specific protocol error |

See [Errors](/docs/reference/errors) for the error classes that use these codes.
